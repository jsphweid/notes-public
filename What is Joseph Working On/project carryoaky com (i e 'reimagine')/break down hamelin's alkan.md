Ya, this is going to be hard

# TODOs

- [[ ]  extract MIDI from Hamelin's performance with [Onsets and Frames  Dual-Objective Piano Transcription (2018)]]
- [ ]  find MIDI online of the piece
- [ ]  HARD: somehow use the tempo and dynamics (?) from Hamelin's track but the correct notes from the source of truth to make a definitive version
    - [ ]  
- [ ]  extract any melodies that you want to preserve
- [ ]  use the automated system to breakdown the rest

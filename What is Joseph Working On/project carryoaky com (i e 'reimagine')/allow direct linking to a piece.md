# allow direct linking to a piece

Depedency: BE cards
Status: Completed

# Overview

A user should go directly to a piece if it's in the url. NOTE: I'm assuming the old app didn't have any of this

# TODOs

- [ ]  use query param or url like `piece=123abc` or `/piece/123abc`
- [ ]  do BE work to make that happen

[SPOTIFY PLAYLIST](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7BJ3LBal3gvgHVvLNqbIhC?si=26ef349ed30a4668)

### Lag Ja Gale (Ab?)

- acoustic guitar (classical?) intro, and plucked guitar throughout
- intricate patterns with bass at times too
- pretty open ended
- interesting harmonies in the end

### Tujhe Kitna Chahein Aur

- opens with voice, then voice+bass, then arpeggiating acoustic guitar
- has swell in the middle, could be like porter robinson, end kind of sounds like smashing pumpkins

### Kya Mujhe Pyaar Hai

- acoustic guitar intro
- opens up into modern produced hindi music
- towards the end a little subtle lead
- lots Ohs Ohs chorus thing

### Teri Deewani

- big vocal intro, then synth pad
- transitions more into an acoustic rock sort of dave matthewsy song, intricate
- acoustic instrument solo in the middle
- bass does cool stuff

### Bachna Ae Hasinon Lo Main...

- acoustic instruments
- old song
- lots of soloistic stuff in beginning and middle (probably throughout)
- probably requires a lot of people
- more alternative version ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4PMUZ055vc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4PMUZ055vc))
    - can go with this but use original if we have more members

# Alternative songs

- intro
    - anup playing [this](https://open.spotify.com/track/6nZiYSBwPQ7fYnVWkkkj4g?si=de1f7c674bc84ae1) guitar
        - honestly this sounded really good when Anup played it
- last
    - Urvashi Urvashi
        - kinda cool, but not sure it's really last song worthy
    - Vande Mataram
        - big intro, overall big sound
        - probably better than Urvashi Urvashi
- Anup's song
    -

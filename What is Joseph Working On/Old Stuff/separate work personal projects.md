# separate work/personal projects

I was alarmed to see:

Using git on my work computer makes it seem like this is for ES and it's not. I need to fix this ASAP. I use my work computer for everything, which is not ideal and opens this up to possible legal weirdness if my employer makes an issue with it.

NOTE: The best way to solve this would be to simply do all personal projects on a separate laptop...

I need to make it **extraordinarily** **easy** to switch between work and personal projects:

- make a command line util that switches everything with a script...?
    - swaps out
        - [x]  pip resolvers (kind of already have this)
        - [x]  git username / login
        - [x]  google chrome profiles
        - [ ]  ~~password managers...?~~
        - [ ]  ~~pycharm...?~~

# Design the integration

Dependency: [[]] 
Status: Completed

use notion integration creatively, make boards and integrate with sites, make part of [josephweidinger.com](http://josephweidinger.com) react to it

# TODO

- [ ]  make more cards??? CURRENTLY STUCK ON LINKS IN NOTION, how do I link?
    - [ ]  actually it just removes hyphens
- [ ]  turn these things into cards by the end...
- [ ]  can the site be accessible to public read-only?

# big picture ideas

## 1. make a giant log

will it be static with the page or dynamically loaded? 

- a small portion should be on my main page, but people can expand the log by clicking on it and it dynamically loads more items

### streams

use streams of data somehow somehow

- be focused
- github streams
- notion updates
- blog updates...?

## 2. public notion boards

- they will be public somehow, read-only
- gotta be careful with accidentally copy/pasting like a password or revealing sensitive data
    - make `public` category distinction somehow?
    - only sync when I hit a button (but make it easy to push often obviously)

# investigate k8s as a method of hosting at edge like chick fil a

Status: Completed

One of the problems of this is that unlike chick fil a, this is very demanding in terms of compute, and having big machines at edge is probably way too expensive to think about

I have no need for this now, but I will continue to experiment with running things locally and maybe accumulate a little k8s knowledge along the way. 

One thing that might be simple for now is running k8s on my gaming computer and have a container for tensorflow-serving (gpu) and another container for running the routing and preprocessing.

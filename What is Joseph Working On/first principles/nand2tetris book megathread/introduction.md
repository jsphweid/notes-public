# introduction

machine language is just another abstraction/contract/agreed upon set of binary codes

- [ ]  what are binary codes?

hardware device - a bunch of elementary logic gates which are built from primitive gates, which are constructed from switching devices, typically transistors

- [ ]  not 100% sure what transistors do yet, but what else could be used?
- transistors are the bottom of what we care about

Seems like the special language that Brian was talking about is Jack. Then "Hack is a general purpose computing system"

I'm curious on VMs and where VMs are used in a standard computer. I only know or think of VMs like Docker, but it's an incredibly narrow understanding. I'm really confused in all the places they talk about VM. 

- [ ]  what does this mean: "As with Java and C#, the intermediate code generated by the Jack compiler describes a sequence of generic steps operating on a stack-based virtual machine (VM). This classical model, as well as a VM implementation that realizes it on an actual computer, are elaborated in chapters 7â€“8."
- [ ]  "Since the output of our VM implementation is a large assembly program, we have to translate it further into binary code." - Is this not usually the case?!?!?

Compiling involves parsing the code and then generating more code essentially.

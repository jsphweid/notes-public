# source code dives

Status: to start

I would like to read some code bases. In particular, I'm interested in looking at the first commit for these projects:

- python
- git - [[git initial commit]]
- linux
- node
- llvm/clang
- posix

In some of these projects, it'd be nice to actually boot up the first version of these things and see what they run.

[[git initial commit]]

[[brief C primer]]

[[node]]

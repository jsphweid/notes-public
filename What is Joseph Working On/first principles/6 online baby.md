Status: geohot stuff not sure I'm gonna do

- [ ]  build TCP stack in C - Probably coded in the kernel, integrate the ethernet driver into the kernel. Add support for networking syscalls to kernel. (send, recv, bind, connect)
- [ ]  telnetd, the power of being multiprocess(C, 50) -- Written in C, user can connect multiple times with telnet. Really just a bind shell.
- [ ]  Space saving dynamic linking(C, 300) -- Because we can, explain how dynamic linker is just a user space program. Changes to linker required.
- [ ]  So about that web(C, 500+) -- A “nice” text based web browser, using ANSI and terminal niceness. Dynamically linked and nice, nice as you want.

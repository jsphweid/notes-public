# 5b. Build OS

Status: geohot stuff not sure I'm gonna do

- [ ]  build OS - UNIXish, only user space threads. (open, read, write, close), (fork, execve, wait, sleep, exit), (mmap, munmap, mprotect). Consider the debug interface you are using, ranging from printf to perhaps a gdbremote stub into kernel. Break into subchapters.

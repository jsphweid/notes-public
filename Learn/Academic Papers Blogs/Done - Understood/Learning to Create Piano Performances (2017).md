In contrast to generating piano sheet music, this is going to describe how to create piano performances.

By performances, it means MIDI representations. 

- [x]  Does this generate midi notes from nothing or does it use piano notes as some form of external conditioning???!
    - this [https://magenta.tensorflow.org/performance-rnn](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/performance-rnn) makes me think that it only learns from real human-created midi (not score derived)
    

Made more data by transposing the existing library up and down and speeding it up and slowing it down as well.

Seems like a pretty straight-forward RNN trained that generates music like it has seen.

# LEARNING COMPLEX BASIS FUNCTIONS FOR INVARIANT REPRESENTATIONS OF AUDIO (2019)

A big problem with basic audio feature extraction (FFT) is that it is not invariant to transpositions. Spectrograms are better for this reason. Transposing doesn't necessarily change the inherent shape.

This is really cool.

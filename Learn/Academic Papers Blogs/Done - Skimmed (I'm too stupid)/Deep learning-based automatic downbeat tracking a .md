# Deep learning-based automatic downbeat tracking: a brief review (2019)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03870v1.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03870v1.pdf)

There is beat detection... then there is downbeat detection...

steps

1. segmentation - limiting the search space
2. feature extraction - getting features (chord changes, rhythmic patterns, etc)
3. feature learning - somehow piping above through different neural nets?
4. feature combination - use average from above?
5. temporal decoding - output a "likelihood sequence"

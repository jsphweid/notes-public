This paper is going to be hard...

It trains by looking at Bach segments, erasing bits and pieces, and then trying to guess what they were (like in-painting).

Honestly, anything this complicated can't be productive. Not for me anyways. I've seen far simpler things do far more interesting things. This is such a low value grab. I'd need a PhD to get anything out of this paper and it doesn't even seem monumental at all. Hard pass.

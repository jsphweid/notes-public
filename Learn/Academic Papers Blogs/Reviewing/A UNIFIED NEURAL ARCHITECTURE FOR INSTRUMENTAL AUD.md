# A UNIFIED NEURAL ARCHITECTURE FOR INSTRUMENTAL AUDIO TASKS (2019)

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00142v1.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00142v1.pdf)

Has [lots of stars on GitHub](https://github.com/r9y9/wavenet_vocoder)... there must be something to this (NOTE: is this even totally related to the paper)

Uses GANs. Seeks to more generalize all the MIR tasks

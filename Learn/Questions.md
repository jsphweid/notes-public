# Questions

- Why can't feature selection or feature extraction be a learned process itself? In other words, why can't we just give a NN the data and it learns and optimizes itself.

### for Anup (or any other PhD candidate)

- How do papers come about?
- How do you know if someone else is working on it or not?
- How do you read papers? What do you do if you don't understand?
- There are of course lots of references to other papers... do you read those too or are you generally familiar with those references anyways?

### for Chris Olah or someone similar (who works with visual NNs alot)

- [x]  what's the simplest way you can describe the process of generating the "images of neurons"
    - actually just read this again: [https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/)
    

### for audio expert

- if our ears and its structure have evolved over time to perceive the things that we perceive by acting as this processing layer, is convolution/FFT/etc. these basic tools for an ANN to solve various audio tasks? If that's the case, might we be able to evolve other tools (rather than using human created ones) using a NN? Maybe there is a more optimal set of tools that can be built from the ground up instead of relying on FFT (for instance)?

### For circuit expert

- why do we constantly say it goes from + to - when it actually goes the opposite way???
- 

### for network expert

- what's the point of mentioning OSI model when it's not used

# Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients

Cepstrum â†’ Spectrum

The Coefficients are numbers that essentially describe an MFC.

What they seem like to me is it's basically a form of dimensionality reduction / feature extraction.

Sounds like they are not useful for pitch detection because they are destructive to the frequency spectrum. But they are good for understand timbre.

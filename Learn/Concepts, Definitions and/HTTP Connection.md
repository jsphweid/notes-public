# HTTP Connection

Looking for clarity

Using insomnia to make an http request to [`http://laughtears.com/sponto_lives.html`](http://laughtears.com/sponto_lives.html)

After doing this several times, I notice text on Insomnia's timeline feature that looks like:

`Re-using existing connection! (#54) with host [laughtears.com](http://laughtears.com/)`

`Connection #54 to host [laughtears.com](http://laughtears.com/) left intact`

- [ ]  what's that all about?

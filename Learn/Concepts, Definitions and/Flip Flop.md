"sequential logic devices" that have memory built in

can be made from logic gates

different types - JK, T, D, but D is the most common

SR Flip Flop / SR Latch, 

- 2 inputs
    - set
    - reset
- 2 outputs
    - Q
    - not Q - "typically the opposite of Q"
        - what's the point of providing that if it's always the inverse...?
        - does "typically" mean always?
- can be active high / active low
    - active high - inputs are normally low (0) and goes to 1 when active
    - active low - just the opposite
    

Called **registers** often because of the state they store. 

- [ ]  WAIT, does this mean like CPU registers in CPU design? Like when an instruction from memory is copied to a register in RISC architecture???!

# Resistor

resists the flow of electricity... caps the current so you don't overload something on a circuit

But how is it made??

### Carbon film

### Metal film

less noise (resistors make noise..>?!?!), better temperature stability, more $$$

lower tolerance - so they are actually closer to what they say they are in terms of resistance measurement 

- [ ]  A resistor has a power rating, but does it have a current rating? Does that even make sense?
    - probably not I think because it seems like through V=IR, I and V are in a linear relationship.
    

# Potentiometer

variable resistors

allow us to change the resistance easily

# 3d printing

filament vs. resin

### filament

- melts material as the substance, what I currently think of as 3d printer
    - squeezes out a bead and stacks
- easier to use but result isn't as smooth as resin

### resin

- project light into resin tank, which cures resin
- offer best detail but more of a mess

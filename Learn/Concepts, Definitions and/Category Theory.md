# Category Theory

from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVDKhxLTGzc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVDKhxLTGzc)

helps us see patterns

instead of what's its label or what set is it in, think how does it relate to each other

category - something that has objects

- has arrows between objects, they have rules
    - called maps/morphisms
    - associativity (A → B → C is same as A → C)
- has arrows to other categories
    - called functors
        - structure preserving
            - [ ]  what does this mean?
                - arrows that form structure in each category (from and to) are preserved in both categories
                    - [ ]  examples...

"category theory forces us to consider objects as instances in context"

context means category

"an object is defined by its context, not its content"

functors are a "recontexualization"

comparison between constructions (aka functors) is a natural transformation

Arrows!

- 0 paths (to itself) - identity
- 1 path - morphism
- 2 paths - composition
- 3 paths - associativity law of composition
    - [ ]  always though?

"Taking Perspective" means thinking about context over content

# Switches (relays, transistors, etc.)

These behave like switches that turn other switches. There is also some element of leverage in that a very low powered signal can control a larger one.

The general idea of these line of switches seems to be a solution of automating the control of other circuits with a switch.

This is a very basic capability. If you wire them differently, you can make basic logic gates (watch [this](https://youtu.be/fB85NrUBBhQ?t=140))

# history

1. [[Computer Relays]] 
2. Vacuum Tubes non-mechanical versions of relays essentially... but the transistor just blows everything out of the water... it's a true difference maker...
3. [[Transistors]] 

A big unknown that is in my brain now is that... I understand how complex logic can be built from simple and/or/etc. and those can be built from nand gates.. (but require and/or/not... right?)

BUT...

- [ ]  how is the nand gate built? like how is in manufactured physically? is it a transistor? multiple transistors?

In the beginning, memory was so difficult to come by â€” to store instructions or anything

abacuses or babbage's difference engine are precursors to the more electronic/automated approach in the 20th century

There's something very mechanical about early computers like the Babbage machine or the Torpedo Data Computer. They were very large sophisticated devices to solve one problem that had probably been solved a while ago but they were just automating it finally. It was incredibly expensive. Vacuum tubes made things better but only slightly in the grand scheme of things. 

Vacuum tubes were known as trans-conductors

The new solid state invention became known as trans-resistors

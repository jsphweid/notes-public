# Subnet Mask

it's a bitmask that can be applied to any ip on the network

bitmask â†’ (`0xFF && 01100011` or whatever)

### but why?

increases speed

- how?
    - reduces broadcast-oriented traffic
        - I guess because if you have 100 computer all broadcasting to each other, but then divide them onto 4 logical subnets, then each machine may only waste the broadcast time with 25 others
    - other benefits like "subnetting enables you to ensure that information remains in the subnetted network or broadcast domain" which is also good, but I don't know what it means

reduces congestion

- seems to be related to the above, broadcast packets don't go to every outlet in a switch â€” I guess that means the switch is aware of the subnet of each port

security

- somewhat obvious, but if you are splitting your network up, it means that certain machines won't be able to talk to other machines (on a different network). this control equates to security

### it's all about dividing network/host

an ipv4 address is 4 bytes

class A - first byte determines the network (sub network?)

class B - first to second byte determines the network

class C - first to third byte determine the network

It's kind of like phone numbers and area codes... maybe back in the day, vienna was 3037 â†’ 6229, but then we require 422-3037 â†’ 422-6229, then 573-422-3037 â†’ 573-422-6229, etc.

If you have two vastly different IPs, say `10.1.1.1` and `10.2.3.4` they may or may not be on the same subnet depending on what the mask is

- if the mask is `255.0.0.0`, they are on the same subnet
- if the mask is `255.255.0.0` or `255.255.255.0`, they are NOT on the same subnet

### Physical Hardware requirements

- a switch cannot 'route' things to other subnets... you need a router for that. According to [this](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-two-computers-connected-to-the-same-switch-with-an-IP-and-Subnet-192-168-0-1-16-and-192-168-1-1-8-ping-each-other-while-being-on-different-networks) a switch routes based on hardware MAC address. Machines use ARP ()

### differences with VLAN

Hmm.. my first impression was that they are the same because a subnetwork is basically a LAN within a LAN, which is what VLAN would almost mean

### common display

you can either see it like `255.255.255.0` which is common on windows it seems or like `0xffffff00`, which I've seen on mac

I guess you can have `255.255.254.0` why not

If machines are on different networks, then the router has to make special forwarding decisions

- [x]  does the internet use a subnet mask? is that a silly question?
    - I'm guessing it operates differently as doing things like broadcast would be so incredibly expensive. maybe like each bit in an ip network is part of the mask ðŸ¤” except last? idk lol
    - the internet is a bunch of connected networks while a subnet is within a singular network
- [ ]  it has routing tables

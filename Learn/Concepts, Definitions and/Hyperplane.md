# Hyperplane

n-dimensional divider that is one less dimension than the space that it's placed in (ambient space)

- 1 dimensional line would have a 0 dimensional point
- 2 dimensional XY graph would have a 1 dimensional vector separating two plots
- 3 dimensional XYZ graph would have a 2 dimensional plane separating two plots
- etc.

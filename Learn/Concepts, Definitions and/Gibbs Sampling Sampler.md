# Gibbs Sampling/Sampler

from wikipedia: "a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for obtaining a sequence of observations which are approximated from a specified multivariate probability distribution, when direct sampling is difficult"

A lot of words that I don't know. But for a vague idea...

Probability Distribution - "mathematical function that gives us probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes for an experiment. It is a mathematical *description* of a random phenomenon *in terms of its sample space and the probabilities of events*.

What the MCMC does (I think) is approximate a sequence of samples that fit a given function.

It's randomized.

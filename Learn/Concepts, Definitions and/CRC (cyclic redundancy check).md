# CRC (cyclic redundancy check)

often called checksum but it’s not exactly

checksum is like adding all the bytes up

basically it’s a way to detect errors but it goes a bit further in pointing out where the errors are. A certain checksum might detect 1-bit vs. 2-bit etc.

uses polynomial division (which is apparently easy to implement in 2-bit hardware)

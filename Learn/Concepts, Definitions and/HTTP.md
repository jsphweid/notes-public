# HTTP

protocol the standardizes how computers (client â†” server) communicate

### What problem does it solve?

So you could just open a connection (socket?) with another computer and start sending packets. But how do you know the order of the packets or if one got lost, etc.?

That is actually solved more with TCP in the transport layer. HTTP is application layer

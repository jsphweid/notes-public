# Transistors

- switch with no moving parts (use #1)
- amplify weak signals, (use #2)
    - basically, since it takes a small amount of current? to control a larger amount, if we apply a small signal, it will become a large signal
        - [ ]  this explanation sounds horrible... fix
- typically made from silicon (a semiconductor)
    - semiconductor
- they can store memory, make flip-flops, a seemingly fundamental element of digital computing

two(?) types

bipolar junction transistors - NPN, PNP types

field effect

There seems to be two sizes

1. large - they may or may not require a heat sink

2. very very tiny - the ones that fit on a CPU?

3 pins are labeled E, B, C

Emitter - output (loops around to Base)

Base - controller

Collector - input

use a small voltage/current in order to control a larger voltage/current - amplification

- a transistor has a goal of an amplification amount, but if it can't go any higher, it's said to be "saturated"
    - [ ]  but shorts somehow?
- the opposite is "cutoff"

transistors are currently like 5nm. the smallest they can get is apparently 0.5-1nm, which is a few atoms wide.

### history

started with 

1. field-effect transistors (FET) (by some physicist)
2. point-contact transistors (which were worse but not patented)
3. MOSFET - metal-oxide semiconductor FET

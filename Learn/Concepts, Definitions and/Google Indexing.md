# Google Indexing

from watching this video, it seems like it's a pretty traditional book index search at first

NOTE: this description is primitive and old

Sites are indexed by looking at words. When a word appears on a webpage, its words are stored by the word and the documents it points to.

When a search comes in, it looks at all the pages that are in the index for those words and throws out ones that don't include both words (or at least deprioritizes them)

The ones that are left is when the ranking process begins. If two words are in that order, then they appear pretty high on the list. Then if a site's reputation is good it appears higher. And there are apparently hundreds of other factors that rank results, but that's the basic idea.

# Computer Logic

### combinatorial logic

- probably what I immediately think of, and/or gates and what not (boolean circuits)
- time-independent
- like pure functions
- does not request a clock to operate

### sequential logic

- not only depends on inputs but also on the **history** of the input (has memory)

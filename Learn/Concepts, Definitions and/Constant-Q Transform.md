# Constant-Q Transform

Like FFT but maybe logarithmic on frequency axis (?)

Sounds similar to the mel-scale because it aligns more with how humans perceive sound (IE, we can hear differences in frequency better towards the lower end)

The relative positions of harmonics remains constant as fundamental pitch changes. This is big!

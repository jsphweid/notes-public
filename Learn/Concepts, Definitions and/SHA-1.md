# SHA-1

Secure Hash Algorithm (but it's broken or figured out)

Hash Algorithms take content and smash it into a pseudo random string of fixed length... but it's predictable

Other hash functions â†’ SHA-256, SHA-512 (SHA-2), MD4, MD5

SHA-1 - takes any length str and outputs 160 bits

Not reversible mainly because of the overflow/wrapping %32

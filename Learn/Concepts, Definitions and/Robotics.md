AC vs. DC

brushed vs. brushless (typical dc distinction)

- brushed motors are simpler and easier to operate
    - most common is permanent magnet dc motor
- brushless better and quieter but presumably more expensive

sync vs. async (typical ac distinction)

commutator - "rotary" switch that reverses current direction 

stepper motor

rail carriage, wheel bearing + motor + odrive

# Conditional Probability

The probability of A given B. P(A/B)

For example. The probability of being a male AND alcoholic is 2.25%. The probability of being a man is 50%. So what if we ask, "what's the probability of being an alcoholic GIVEN that you are a man."

It's defined as P(A & B) / P(B)

So 0.0225 / 0.5 â‡’ 4.5%

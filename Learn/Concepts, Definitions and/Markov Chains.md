# Markov Chains

Markov Chains model - modeling sequence of random events using states and transitions between states

The big kicker with these chains is that the next only depends on the previous. It is memory-less.

There also seems to be this idea of convergence. 

Historically people thought of a perfect blueprint for everything and observation of the universe slowly converged on that blueprint

Seems like a horribly simplistic way of looking at things â€” as most things have dependencies, sometimes very distant dependencies

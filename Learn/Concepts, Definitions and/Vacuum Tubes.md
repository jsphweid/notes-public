# Vacuum Tubes

have a wide variety of uses, like amplification, rectification, as diodes, switches

diodes have high resistance in one direction and low resistance in another

without a vacuum, electrons will crash into air molecules

for a tv, an electron gun fires electrons while a magnet steers it in the correct direction

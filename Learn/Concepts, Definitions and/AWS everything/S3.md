# S3

Object storage not block storage

Block storage is when you have a big volume and it's attached to some computing instance

Buckets are private by default

Bucket names are pretty picky (no underscores/spaces, must start with first letter)

### Versioning

once you go versioning, you can't go back... you can go to suspended though

if you want to make an object public, you have to do that for each version

default deletes are soft deletes, unless you specify a version ID

suspending just keeps previous versions but makes the latest replacable

### Encryption

client v. server side

server side can be more managed and automated to varying degrees

client side requires encrypting the object before it even reaches S3

### Tag

helps identify and separate resources into user-defined organizations

helpful for creating good aws cost reporting

tagset of a bucket can include up to 10 keys or be empty

keys have to be unique (like a map/dict)

### Transfer Acceleration

region to region speedy transfer

basically routes traffic through cloudfront edge locations

good for large files across continents

### Muti-part

allows you to upload multiple parts and retry certain ones without retrying the entire upload operation

### Events

Use SNS as pubsub

### Bucket Policy and ACL

yada whatever

### Object Lifecycle Management

transition - object needs to be in a class for 30 days after last transition?

expiration - delete only needs to wait 1 day..?

can apply to all or begins_with key filters

saves costs

applies to all items in the bucket that already exist

### Cross Region Replication

requires a role to do the transfer

only new objects added after the replication will be replicated

encryption stays the same it seems

- everything is replicated except objects encrypted with SSE-C encryption
- objects in source bucket where the owner doesn't have permissions
- lifecycle updates
- replicated objects aren't replicated

deletes without a version ID, S3 adds a delete marker which is replicated, but ones with version ID only deletes the source for some reason...

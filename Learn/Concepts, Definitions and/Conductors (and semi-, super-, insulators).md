# Conductors (and semi-, super-, insulators)

materials (typically metal, __) that allow electrical signals to pass through at varying degrees

it's a spectrum after superconductors

- superconductor - no resistance below a certain temp.. power can be contained inside a loop indefinitely
- conductor - has very little resistance
- semiconductor - has a fair amount of resistance (resistance to touch)
    - basically made out of a material that is an insulator but then coated with a varying amount of conductive material to conduct a specific amount. There's a lot of gray area here though
- resistor/insulator - mostly prohibits electrical conductivity, limiting the current

# Semiconductors

## CONFUSION

It's funny how it's hard to find WHY

Like yes, I get it... semiconductors are very important for electronic devices. They conduct less than a conductor. But WHY IS THAT BETTER?!?!?!?!? So many definitions do not explain enough

## Possible Resolution

from [here](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/29373)

history (of turning on/off electrical switches)

1. relays
    - large in space, consume lots of power, slow, noisy
2. vacuum tubes
    - large in space, consume lots of power, but more reliable than relays
3. semiconductors
    - cheap, small, etc.

SO APPARENTLY it's a bit of a misnomer?? Like semiconductors are used as cheap fast switches (somehow?). It's not necessarily about their conductivity..???

## Silicon

is basically an insulator but when it is doped (impurities added) it becomes a semiconductor

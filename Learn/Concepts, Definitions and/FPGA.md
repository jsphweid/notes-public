Field Programmable Gate Array

integrated circuit designed to be reprogrammed with HDL

This differs from ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit)

FPGAs basically have an insanely fluid structure that allows them to be repogrammed

![[/Untitled.png]]

Despite this fluidity, they can still be extremely efficient somehow?

- [ ]  how are they efficient/fast?

I had assumed that they would only be used for R&D, but the video mentions they have legit commercial applications

A problem I have with being introduced to FPGAs is that reading about them makes me think they are everywhere and really really important but...

- I've never heard of them before...
- I don't think I can think of any places they are used even after learning about them (I may not have learned enough about them to know where they are used ðŸ¤”)
    - ASICs are easy to understand and visualize (bitcoin miners)
    - CPUs/GPUs/ICs/Microcontrollers/SoCs, that accounts for almost everything I've ever seen I feel like...
- [ ]  answer?

# Differentiable Image Parameterizations (2018)

what are these "parameterizations"???

since feature visualization is stochastic, re-runs of this process can yield completely results (different locations of the eyes every time). That's why you use "aligned interpolation" â€” visual landmarks stay in place

- [ ]  how do you do this
    - apparently through "shared parameterization" but it makes no sense to me yet

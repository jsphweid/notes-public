# Groups & Group Convolutions (2014)

[https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-12-Groups-Convolution/](https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-12-Groups-Convolution/)

starts off with this big thing of rotating squares to introduce groups and group actions

groups are abstract patterns. and there are group patterns.

It can be simple to think about this in Euclidean Space, where we reason about points by their relative location to an origin.

In regards to the rotating square idea, certain transformations take us back to where we started. But where we started is arbitrary, kind of like the origin on a graph is â€” (0, 0).

addition/subtraction

multiplication/division

rotate/flip

you have a graph, and points relative to it, called positions

# Neural Networks, Manifolds, and Topology (2014)

you need enough layers to learn the complexity of the problem

neural nets bend the data so the representation is linearly separable even when the initial problem was likely not

If you believe in the [[The Manifold Hypothesis]], then the task of a classification algorithm is fundamentally to separate a bunch of tangled manifolds

continuous deformation of manifolds is the "untangling" described above. Note that cuts or stitching is not allowed

It seems that neural nets just try to untangle the manifolds by using a naive approach and find some local minimum. This isn't ideal. Ideally we'd go right to the absolute minimum with a superior algorithm/model. But I don't really know what I'm talking about.

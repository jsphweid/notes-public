# Understanding Convolutions (2014)

[https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Understanding-Convolutions/](https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Understanding-Convolutions/)

the post about convolutions before this one seemed to be a different take on convolutions (higher level) â€” the actual behavior of convolutions is detailed in this paper

There's a lot of stuff in here about probability distributions that I don't understand (because convolutions can be viewed from many angles/disciplines), but towards the end, this really stuck out to me.

Notice how the weights are shared. `[W0, W1]` is the kernel

I could use another pass at the probability distribution part. Although if I commit to doing that in the future, I really need to take it more seriously...

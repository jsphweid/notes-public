"circuits" seem to be about the wiring of neurons â€” and what the wiring says about their world

"direction" is a linear combination of neurons in a layer 

Not every neuron offers a perfect little visualization with for humans

- polysemantic neurons - for example, "InceptionV1 contains one neuron that responds to cat faces, fronts of cars, and cat legs."

claim 1 - features are a fundamental unit of NNs (neuron?)

claim 2 - circuits (formation of a few neurons) are important

claim 3 - universality, you see the same neurons forming across different networks (the same one trained multiples or even different networks)

the last part was mainly focused musing a way of directing the study of NNs as to promote truth finding. Thinking about NNs as a whole is too broad. It's too complicated to understand what is going on to derive deep truths about its operation. But if you look at circuits and study them rigorously, you can arrive at those truths

worried about it being qualitative research, but could still be very important. this is discovery

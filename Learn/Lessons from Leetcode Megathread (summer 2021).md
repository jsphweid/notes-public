# Language specific

### python

1. splitting a string into a list of chars is as easy as `list(string)` do not use `.split("")` as `split` cannot accept an empty string. Another way would be a list comprehension `[char for char in string]` learned [here](https://github.com/jsphweid/chops/blob/main/lc/answers/plus-one/2021.08.23-23.46.03.py) **+1**
2. `set("123abc")` will make `{"1", "2", "3", "a", "b", "c"}`
3. `strip()` removes all whitespace at the beginning and end of the string (it's NOT "trim")
4. best way to reverse string is `[::-1]`, not `"".join(reversed(str))`
    
    [[Python List [[Python List Primer]]
    
5. `str.count("a")`
6. there is no .lowercase() method on a string, it's `.lower()`
7. `"5".isdigit()` does what you think it does 
8. `"a".isalpha()` (also) does what you think it does
9. `"a1".isalnum()` (also) does what you think it does
10. can't concatenate string and num like `"something" + 5`
11. strings don't support index assignment! **+2**
12. `.startswith` is useful (instead of checking .index == 0 and try catching)
    1. safe with empty strings
13. `format` can come in handy, especially when printing out padded binary - 
    - `"{:08b}".format(i)`
        - [ ]  write a more in-depth article on this
14. `pop(0)` pops from the first index (although consider using a deque instead as popleft is O(1))
15. `.insert(0, var)` adds item to beginning of list (unlike `.append()` which is end) (although again, considering using a deque because it's O(1))
16. `map` and other similar functions take in a fn as a first arg and list as a second arg
17. `[5] * 3` creates `[5, 5, 5]`
    1. can't multiply sequence by non-int (`[5] * 3.0`) is not allowed
18. `mylist.index(item)` is handy
19. `.sort()` is ascending by default, you can change this with `reverse=True` argument (same with `sorted()` (since the first arg is the list you want to sort...)
20. flatten a list like `[item for items in lst for item in items]` or just write it out longways if that's too confusing
21. can't do `len(filter(etc.))`
22. `.union()` joins two sets, `.intersection()` gets the common ones
    1. NOTE: `-` `|` `&` `^` do exactly what you think they do
23. `zip` turns n lists into tuples by index, NOTE: shortest list determines length
24. you can destructure a list of n items like `head, *rest = long_list`
25. `bisect` module for easy binary search
    
    [[bisect in [[bisect in python]]
    
26. `bisect.insort` can be used to insert an item in a sorted array easily (arr, num)
27. `float('inf')` exists and is useful, can also use `from math import inf`
28. `d.items()` exists but so does `d.values()` and `d.keys()`
29. `dict.keys()` doesn't exactly return a set (so don't use methods like `.intersection()`
    1. NOTE: `a | b` works but not `a.union(b)` ðŸ¤”
30. careful with single line multivariable assignment... `l1, l2 = {}, {}` is right `l1 = l2 = {}` is wrong (l1 and l2 will BOTH point to the *same* dict)
31. `from fractions import Fraction` `Fraction(1,4)+Fraction(1,4)` â‡’ `1/2`
32. dict values aren't scriptable... i.e. `d.values()[0]` isn't a thing (same with keys â€” probably because it's set-like)
33. `math.log(1000, 10)` yields `2.9999999999999996` ... use `math.log10`
34. `divmod` is simple way of integer dividing + carry, i.e. `divmod(5, 2)` â‡’ `(2, 1)`
    1. quotient and remainder
35. you can leverae secondary sorts by returning a tuple in the sort function
    1. can also use in in max/min to save a secondary value without having to maintain multiple variables
36. `issubset` you can think like `a.issubset(b)` a is subset OF b
37. use `Counter` it's a shortcut to many problem answers, has cool methods like `most_common`
38. `while` `else`
39. `discard` safely removes item from set, whereas `remove` will throw error if not in there

### MORE

1. Counter.elements() â†’ can be converted back to list with list(), omits if some values have moved to 0 since taking count
2. `zip` doesnâ€™t take up more memory unless you wrap it in list() or sorted() or something
3. `defaultdict` takes in a function that returns a value more specifically 
    - `default_factory` - is what itâ€™s called
    - `treeid.default_factory = treeid.__len__` - uses len function to essentially get a unique ID for that unique item
4. `SortedDict` (not OrderedDict) is very useful `from sortedcontainers import SortedDict`
    - `pop()` is used to remove a key (same as normal dict...) or `del d[key]`
    - `peekitem(i)` can easily get `(0)` or `(-1)` i.e. first or last real easily
    - think it works just by keeping a sorted list on keys and doing binary search a lot
5. `math.gcd` exists.. LCM can be gotten from that `abs(a*b) // math.gcd(a, b)`
6. `[[]] * 5` makes `[[], [], [], [], []]`
7. somehow I keep making goofs... iterating over items of dict `d` is `d.items()` 
8. `ord` and `chr`
9. `Counter` has an `update` method to make it easy to count more than one thing
10. in `enumerate` `start` just changes the index startâ€¦ itâ€™s not an offset

# Mathy stuff

[[Logarithms]]

[[Shoelace [[Shoelace Formula]]

[[combinations and [[combinations and permutations]]

- completing the square (`k**2 + k - 2n â‰¤ 0` get `k` on one side...)
- 0 and 1 are not prime by definition

[[slope intercept [[slope intercept form]]

- `1//2` is 0 but `-1//2` is -1...

# General

- integer division always "rounds down" (discards decimals)
- need more confidence around recursion
    
    [[Recursion]]
    
- I don't always consider edge cases
- I probably need to be more regimented about "whiteboarding" even if only in sublime
- modulo operator makes a decent hashing function

[[Dynamic [[Dynamic Programming]]

- it's not fair to describe`O(n^2)` as exponential, but squared since that exponent is constant. exponential would be something like `n^m` (you might say quadratic)

# Questions

- [x]  when can a recursive function not be used? seems in `maximum-depth-of-binary-tree` that recursive functions can't be used because there are not enough state variables
    - [x]  Jesse P helped me realize this was possible and once I thought about it from a slightly different perspective I was able to solve it
- [ ]  is traversing a binary tree layer by layer starting at the top with a queue an appropriate solution?
    - the problem is we have to enhance the data structure to also store the depth if we need it
- [ ]  threads vs. cores vs. ??

- [ ]  understanding [prefix state map](https://liuzhenglaichn.gitbook.io/algorithm/prefix-state-map), encountered in [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/discuss/1515501/C%2B%2B-Prefix-State-Map-Two-Pointers-Sliding-Window)

## From Clay

- 5 step optimization (cracking the coding interview)

## What I've learned from wasting time on hard problems

- [https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/) took me around 3-4 hours... but I feel more confident in general after solving it. I can solve anything I put my mind to. In this problem, it was rather easy to see what needed to be done but hard to imagine programming it. I had to ask myself very deeply "How do I know how to do this" and in pondering that was able to find the correct path forward (eventually)

# Reviewing

- [ ]  the practice I needed, easy just in time - [https://youtu.be/CtQCxc8xYeY?t=9021](https://youtu.be/CtQCxc8xYeY?t=9021)
- [ ]  seems like I often start something and just continue without understanding it
    - ignore clues in plain sight

# Video ideas

- [ ]  shortest-path-to-get-food - medium, i did pretty well on it, can explain it easily
    - use whiteboard video a bit
- [ ]  asteroid-collision - medium, got right after an hour though, a few TLEâ€™s, but optimized it too
- [ ]  stepping numbers - decent lessons and I did come up with a good solution by myself, then optimized according to what is in the discussions
- [ ]  number-of-students-doing-homework-at-a-given-time - stupidly easy easy
- [ ]  edit-distance - HARD was able to do by myself, but took like 2 hours
- [ ]  divide chocolate - HARD question but not done - Jason recommended
- [ ]  number-of-matching-subsequences

Video review checklist

- [ ]  voice overs sound different?
- [ ]  voice overs have black and white?
- [ ]  nothing clipping?
- [ ]  beginning and end have good amount of time
- [ ]  music where appropriate?
